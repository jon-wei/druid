# Native Index Tasks

Druid currently two types of native index tasks, i.e., `local index task` and `single phase parallel index task`.

Single Phase Parallel Index Task
--------------------------------

The Single Phase Parallel Index Task is a task for parallel batch indexing. This task only uses Druid's resource and
doesn't depend on other external systems like Hadoop. This task works in a single phase without shuffling intermediate
data. `index_single_phase_parallel` task is a supervisor task which basically creates multiple worker tasks and submits
them to overlords. Each worker task reads input data and makes segments. Once they successfully generate segments for all
input, they report the generated segment list to the supervisor task. The supervisor task periodically checks the worker
task statuses. If one of them fails, it retries the failed task until the retrying number reaches the configured limit.
If all worker tasks succeed, then it collects the reported list of generated segments and publishes those segments at once.

To use this task, the `firehose` in `ioConfig` should be _splittable_. If it's not, this task runs sequentially. The
current splittable fireshoses are [`LocalFirehose`](./firehose.html#localfirehose), [`HttpFirehose`](./firehose.html#httpfirehose)
, [`StaticS3Firehose`](../development/extensions-core/statics3firehose), [`StaticAzureBlobStoreFirehose`](../development/extensions-contrib/staticazureblobstorefirehose)
, [`StaticGoogleBlobStoreFirehose`](../development/extensions-contrib/staticgoogleblobstorefirehose), and [`StaticCloudFilesFirehose`](../development/extensions-contrib/staticcloudfilesfirehose).

The splittable firehose is responsible for generating _splits_ which is an input of each worker tasks generated by the
supervisor task. As a result, the number of worker tasks depends on the implementation of splittable firehoses.

Since this task doesn't shuffle intermediate data, it isn't available for [perfect rollup](../design/index.html). 

An example ingestion spec is:

```json

Common Configurations
---------------------

#### IndexSpec

The indexSpec defines segment storage format options to be used at indexing time, such as bitmap type and column
compression formats. The indexSpec is optional and default parameters will be used if not specified.

|Field|Type|Description|Required|
|-----|----|-----------|--------|
|bitmap|Object|Compression format for bitmap indexes. Should be a JSON object; see below for options.|no (defaults to Concise)|
|dimensionCompression|String|Compression format for dimension columns. Choose from `LZ4`, `LZF`, or `uncompressed`.|no (default == `LZ4`)|
|metricCompression|String|Compression format for metric columns. Choose from `LZ4`, `LZF`, `uncompressed`, or `none`.|no (default == `LZ4`)|
|longEncoding|String|Encoding format for metric and dimension columns with type long. Choose from `auto` or `longs`. `auto` encodes the values using offset or lookup table depending on column cardinality, and store them with variable size. `longs` stores the value as is with 8 bytes each.|no (default == `longs`)|

##### Bitmap types

For Concise bitmaps:

|Field|Type|Description|Required|
|-----|----|-----------|--------|
|type|String|Must be `concise`.|yes|

For Roaring bitmaps:

|Field|Type|Description|Required|
|-----|----|-----------|--------|
|type|String|Must be `roaring`.|yes|
|compressRunOnSerialization|Boolean|Use a run-length encoding where it is estimated as more space efficient.|no (default == `true`)|

#### Segment publishing modes

While ingesting data using the Index task, it creates segments from the input data and publishes them. For segment publishing, the Index task supports two segment publishing modes, i.e., _bulk publishing mode_ and _incremental publishing mode_ for [perfect rollup and best-effort rollup](./design/index.html), respectively.

In the bulk publishing mode, every segment is published at the very end of the index task. Until then, created segments are stored in the memory and local storage of the node running the index task. As a result, this mode might cause a problem due to limited storage capacity, and is not recommended to use in production.

On the contrary, in the incremental publishing mode, segments are incrementally published, that is they can be published in the middle of the index task. More precisely, the index task collects data and stores created segments in the memory and disks of the node running that task until the total number of collected rows exceeds `maxTotalRows`. Once it exceeds, the index task immediately publishes all segments created until that moment, cleans all published segments up, and continues to ingest remaining data.

To enable bulk publishing mode, `forceGuaranteedRollup` should be set in the TuningConfig. Note that this option cannot be used with either `forceExtendableShardSpecs` of TuningConfig or `appendToExisting` of IOConfig.
